supports_transitively(floor, X) :-

% public interface â€” no visited list needed from user
depends_on_safe(Act, Prep) :-

% base case (direct dependency)
depends_on_safe(Act, Prep, _) :-

% recursive case with visited list
depends_on_safe(Act, Prep, Visited) :-

% Usage example:
% ?- depends_on_safe(setup(keyboard), X).
% X = setup(power_supply_kb) ;
% X = setup(piano_shell) ;
% X = unload(piano_shell) ;
% X = load(piano_shell) ;
% false.

% ready_to_play/0 is the over-arching goal. It is the starting goal for when you
% use swipl at the command line. The usage works like this:
%
% swipl -s piano_setup.pl -g ready_to_play -t halt
%
% swipl: The Prolog interpreter we are using.
% -s piano_setup.pl: Consults the file 'piano_setup.pl'.
% -g ready_to_play: Invokes this goal to get things started.
% -t halt: Stops the interpreter after the goal is met. Remove to interact.
ready_to_play :- 
    writeln("Ready to play!").
