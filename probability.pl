% Work here is from Probability Theory, The Logic of Science by Edwin T. Jaynes.
% Started May 1, 2025 while reading Chapter 1 of the book.

% AXIOMS OF PLAUSIBLE REASONING (page references to The Logic of Science)
% Two propositions with the same truth value are equally plausible (p. 10).

% ROBOT
%
% What do we know about Jaynes' robot so far?
%
% The robot is...
% - Imaginary being
% - Designed by us
% - Follows rules
% - Learning tool
% - Defining of rules is design
% - Function: Reason about propositions

% BOOLEAN ALGEBRA
%
% George Boole
%
% Rules of inference are on page 11 of the book.
%
% Boole's and Jaynes' notation:
% AB            = conjunction   = logical product   = logical 'and'
% A+B           = disjunction   = logical sum       = logical 'or'
% \overline{A}  = denial of A
% \overline{AB} = denial of AB conjunction = \overline{A} + \overline{B}
% \overline{A} \overline{B} = denial of both A and B
% 
% Implication:
% A => B means two things:
% 1. If A is true, then AB is true.
% 2. If B is false, then A is false.
% 
% Start next time on page 12, section 1.6, 'Adequate sets of operations' after May 1, 2025.
